# codeQuiz
How it functions:

codeQuiz has prewritten questions within the jquery so it uses the following work flow to render its work.

Once player hits the "start Quizz" button, he/she would initialize the start of the timer and direct them to the quiz questions page.
codeQuiz is setup whereby if the player answers the question correctly, it will take them to the next question. 
However, if the player answers incorrectly, the timer would be deducted by 10secs giving the player less time to answer for the following question.
afterwards, codeQuiz will then display an initials entry towards the bottom for scoreboards.
